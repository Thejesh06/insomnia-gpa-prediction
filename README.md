# Impact of Insomnia on Academic Performance

A research replication and original data collection project examining how student sleep patterns affect GPA, combined with a machine learning classification pipeline and an interactive Streamlit web application.

---

## Overview

This project:
- **Replicates** a published research paper on student sleep and academic performance
- **Collects** primary survey data from our university (768 students)
- **Builds** a 6-model ML classification pipeline to predict GPA category
- **Addresses** a methodological flaw (SMOTE data leakage) in the original paper
- **Deploys** a Streamlit web app for live GPA predictions based on sleep and lifestyle inputs

## Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run full pipeline on base paper dataset
python src/full_pipeline/run_pipeline.py base

# Run full pipeline on survey dataset
python src/full_pipeline/run_pipeline.py survey
```

## Model Comparison Story

| Table | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Table 5 | Logistic Regression + statsmodels | Statistical inference (OR, CI, p-values) |
| Table 6 | 6-model CV, no SMOTE | Baseline — shows class imbalance problem |
| Table 7 | 6-model CV + SMOTE on full data | Replicates base paper exactly |
| **Table 8** | **6-model + SMOTE on train only** | **Our fix — avoids data leakage** |

**Key finding:** We replicated the base paper's methodology (Table 7, RF accuracy ~77%) and then identified a SMOTE data leakage issue in the original approach. Table 8 corrects this with SMOTE applied inside the cross-validation loop.

## Streamlit App

The app predicts a student's GPA category from 7 sleep and lifestyle inputs:

```bash
# Train the model first
python App/model/train_model.py

# Launch the app
streamlit run App/app.py
```

**App features:**
- GPA prediction with decision threshold tuned for class imbalance
- Plotly gauge chart showing P(Good/Excellent GPA)
- Radar chart: Your Profile vs High GPA Average vs Average/Below Average
- Per-feature risk assessment with personalised tips
- Model feature importance panel

## Key Results (Survey Dataset)

| Model | Accuracy | AUC |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Random Forest (Table 7) | 77.4% | **0.864** |
| SVM (Table 7) | 69.2% | 0.763 |
| Decision Tree (Table 7) | 72.7% | 0.728 |
| Random Forest (Table 8 — honest) | 70.8% | 0.701 |
